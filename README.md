# Facebook_Ads_Bidding_AB_Testing
# Project Description
In this project, I conducted an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of Maximum Bidding and Average Bidding strategies on Facebook ads for an e-commerce company. The goal was to determine which bidding method drives higher conversions and provides better performance.

The process involved analyzing control (maximum bidding) and test (average bidding) groups, checking statistical assumptions (normality and homogeneity of variances), and applying independent sample t-tests and proportion z-tests.
Multiple performance metrics such as purchase rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates were evaluated to provide a holistic comparison.

The analysis revealed that while Average Bidding did not significantly outperform Maximum Bidding in terms of overall purchases, it showed higher conversion rates per click, suggesting nuanced trade-offs between the two bidding strategies.
